## Project

Azur Lane fan application for formation management. There is a webapp version at [github pages](http://rutle.github.io/fazla) and then a desktop application using Electron. There is no release yet for the desktop application.

Main idea behind this project was to learn more Typescript and React.

### Main packages
* Electron
* React
* Redux
 
### Misc
Uses raw ship data from [AzurApi-JS](https://azurapi.github.io/).
